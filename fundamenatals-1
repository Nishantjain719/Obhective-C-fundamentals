self is a pointer to myself(the current viewController Object). it has a property called balanceLabel. so self.balanceLabel give sme pointer to that balanceLabel which is of type 
UiLabel and .text gives text value of that label. so i am dynamically allocating string and that call is gonna return a pointer and its gonna assign that address to .text property.
AppDelegate first allocates the viewController and initializes it and after that make view visible(triggering the actual instantiation of all view objects).Parent View UIView object has addgestureenable
method also.
